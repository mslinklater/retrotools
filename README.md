# retrotools

This is really out of date... I'll get to sorting this out soon, honest 8). 

Mainly 6502 stuff

## To Build

To build Retrotools you need a copy of my 'shared_cpp' repo in the source tree. I have it set up so that the 'shared_cpp' project is alongside 'retrotools' project, then symbolicaally link the folder in to retrotools. You could also copy it in... it is up to you. Whichever way you choose you need th make sure the 'shaared_cpp' folder in inside the 'retrotools' folder.

Once that is in, you should be able to build.

1) Make sure you have cmake installed.
2) In a console execute the following commands:

cmake .

make

You should now have the 'vistella' executable in the folder
