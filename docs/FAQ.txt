Frequently Asked Questions for retrotools
=========================================

Development
-----------

Q/ Why did you code it in C++ rather than <blah> ?

A/ C++ is the language I'm most familiar with. I didn't want to mix up the challenge of wiriting the application with the challenge of learning a new language. I might port it at some stage... you can port it if you like. For now it's in C++ because that's the easiest route to it working.

Q/ Why use cmake ?

A/ Cross platform, wide industry support, I wanted to learn it.

Q/ Why use Dear ImGui

A/ Because it is cross platform, lightweight and performant. Ideal for this type of application.

Features
--------

Q/ What machines does it support ?

A/ Currently the Atari 2600 VCS
