Frequently Asked Questions for retrotools
=========================================

Q/ Why did you code it in C++ rather than <blah> ?

A/ C++ is the language I'm most familiar with. I didn't want to mix up the challenge of wiriting the application with the challenge of learning a new language. I might port it at some stage... you can port it if you like. For now it's in C++ because that's the easiest route to it working.

Q/ Why use cmake ?

A/ Cross platform, wide industry support, I wanted to learn it.
